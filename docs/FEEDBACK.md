# Build Status and Feedback (Build Session writes, Design Session reads)

This file is the **only doc file edited by the Build Session** under the two-session split (decision "Two-session split: Design and Build", 2026-11-07).

- **Build Session** updates section 1 and appends items to section 2 (findings, conflicts, sim results, docs deltas).
- **Design Session** reads this file, applies docs deltas to shared docs, updates specs, and records answers in `docs/READY.md` section 4 (`Feedback Responses`). Once answered, Build marks the item `closed` on its next pass.

## 1. Build Status

## 2. Feedback Items (Append-Only)

Entry fields: `Spec`, `Kind` (feasibility, conflict, cost, sim, docs-delta), `Status` (open, answered, closed), `Finding`, `Recommendation`.

FB-01 to FB-248 are closed and moved to `docs/archive/FEEDBACK_CLOSED.md` (2026-11-13). New items start at FB-249. Archived items record `closed: <disposition> (@<commit>)` (UN-05).

## 3. Notes for the user (non-build, read by the Design Session)

The user may not read the build session's chat, so anything outside build work goes here, numbered `UN-nn`: questions or permissions for the user, things that need the user's eyes, process suggestions, and state the user should know. The Design Session relays them; the user's answers come back through `docs/READY.md` section 4 like any other. Fields: `For` (user, design, both), `Status` (open, answered, closed), `Note`, `Ask`.

UN-01 to UN-12 are closed and moved to the archive (2026-11-11). New notes start at UN-13.
